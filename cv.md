### Summary
---
About a year ago I was forced to start teaching computer science to students of an agricultural college. At that time, I did not have a sufficient knowledge base, but I was a confident PC user. While preparing for the classes, I independently mastered the basics of programming and realized that I like it.

I set myself the goal of mastering programming to a professional level and getting a remote job in the field of WEB development. I consider myself capable of learning. Over the past year, I have successfully completed several courses, but I consider it necessary to constantly study.

My disadvantage is poor knowledge of English. I am working to eliminate this shortcoming.
